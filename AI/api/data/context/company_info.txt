Long term and stable career opportunities with global European companies
In 2006, the founders of our company packed their bags in Norway and moved to Ho Chi Minh City with their two young sons aged 4 and 7. They did not have family in Vietnam nor knew anyone in Ho Chi Minh City. But they had a lot of determination and hard work. Their aim was to help talented software engineers in Vietnam get long term and permanent roles and assist top notch tech businesses in Norway access talents, not letting distance hinder the employment. 
They started Facilitated Work Hub in 2007 with their own savings. We offer expert Software Developers in Vietnam with long term employment in top Norwegian companies. Developers in Vietnam and Norway work as colleagues, share the same responsibilities, there is no A team or B team. Developers in Vietnam collaborate directly, spar, discuss and innovate together with their co-workers in Norway on an equal footing. 
Post covid, there are many names for what we do, like remote work, future of work and etc. But we are not into labels, we simply love what we do. Love that many of our employees stay with us long, have gladly helped some settle well in Norway and delighted to welcome new ones to our company.
